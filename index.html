    <p>Welcome! I'm...</p>

        <p>
            I'm a mechanical engineering undergraduate at the University of Florida
            with a focus on autonomous robotics. I love system integration and testing, and my
            goal is to be able to help develop applicable autonomous robotics and systems that can
            impact people everyday! Additionally I have a passion for teaching and working with people,
            and I hope to be able to bring those passions into whatever I do.
