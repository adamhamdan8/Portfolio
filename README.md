# Adam Hamdan's Portfolio
This is a work in progress website that acts as my professional portfolio. Documenting my skills, projects, and experience. This website itself was a project, an opportunity for me to learn basic web development.

## Code

So far the website is going to be in basic HTML, just to not complicate things too much for my first websiste. I might use Python and Flask to actually run and host the website.
